# Technologies used
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for view management
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for global state management
* [ImmutableJs](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) for guaranteed immutable data when working with redux
* [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for URL routing with react
